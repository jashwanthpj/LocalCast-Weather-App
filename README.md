# **LocalCast: A Weather Forecast Application**

**Author**: Jashwanth Podduturi  
**Year**: 2024

## **Project Overview**

LocalCast is a simple yet effective weather forecast application that allows users to search for the current weather conditions in any city worldwide. The application is built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, leveraging the WeatherAPI to fetch real-time weather data.

## **Features**

- **City-Based Weather Search**: Enter the name of any city to get current weather conditions.
- **Dynamic Weather Display**: The application fetches and displays the temperature, weather condition, and humidity of the selected city.
- **Responsive Design**: The user interface is designed to be responsive and user-friendly across all devices.
- **Weather Icons**: Weather conditions are represented visually using relevant icons.

## **Technologies Used**

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - JavaScript

- **API**:
  - WeatherAPI for fetching real-time weather data

## **Project Structure**

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the web page.
- `LocalcastStyle.css`: The CSS file for styling the application.
- `scripts.js`: The JavaScript file that handles form submissions, API requests, and DOM manipulation.
- `condition/`: A folder containing weather icons that visually represent different weather conditions.

## **Installation and Usage**

1. **Clone the Repository**:  
   Clone the project to your local machine using the following command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/localcast.git
   ```

2. **Open the Project**:  
   Navigate to the project directory and open the `index.html` file in your preferred web browser.

3. **Use the Application**:
   - Enter the name of a city in the search field.
   - Click the "search" button to retrieve the current weather conditions.

## **API Integration**

LocalCast uses the [WeatherAPI](https://www.weatherapi.com/) to retrieve real-time weather data. The API key is hardcoded into the JavaScript file (`scripts.js`). If you fork this project or plan to use it independently, you will need to replace the API key with your own.
